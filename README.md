Non-Singleton Hierarchical Fuzzy Logic Controller For a Mobile Robot

This project is an attempt to implement and test a hierarchical fuzzy logic controller with non-singleton inputs on a mobile Pioneer PeopleBot robot. The aim is to see how the algorithm compares to a similar algorithm with crisp inputs. The idea of the crisp input system is borrowed from [1]. The system is going to be using Juzzy[2] in order to implement this system in Java.
