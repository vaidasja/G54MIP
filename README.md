Hierarchical Fuzzy Logic Controller For a Mobile Robot

This project is an attempt to implement and test a hierarchical fuzzy logic controller on a mobile Pioneer PeopleBot robot. The system is going to be using Juzzy[2] in order to implement this system in Java. The aim is to test Juzzy toolkit on a real robot as opposed to the simulator.
